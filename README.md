This repository is used to manage the STEEMPUNK-NET universe. 
You will find here the following documents:

What is STEEMPUNK-NET
------

STEEMPUNK-NET is a browser game that combines blockchain technology, social interaction and a multiplayer role-playing game. 
STEEMPUNK-NET is therefore the first MMORPG to combine social networks with blockchain technology, 
allowing players to earn real cryptographic currencies.

STEEMPUNK-NET loves Utopian
======

How can I submit something to STEEMPUNK-NET via Utopian?
------

Dear SPN player and welcome guest, first of all thank you for your interest. If you want to submit ideas about Utopian Issues, we ask you to not use this repository to submit contributions. In the past, some Utopian mods have been misunderstood because this repository does not comply with the rules.

We recommend that if you want to submit issues, contributions or ideas, you can do so via the following repository:

https://github.com/pcsg/steempunk-net-browser
https://github.com/pcsg/steemit-steempunk-housing


STEEMPUNK-NET loves Utopian
------

**Dear lovely Utopian Mod**, to avoid misunderstandings, this repository does not contain much code (We know that). This repository is the first point of contact for STEEMPUNK-NET players, not only for players but also for editorial offices and other marketing people.

Additionally, the main issues are managed here and users / players can post errors, ideas, bugs and a lot more.

Since STEEMPUNK-NET has a modular structure, this project consists of a dozen repositories.
We cannot require that developers, as well as developers who are not involved (like you) know all our repositories or know how our modularization works.

For example, our main repositories for SPN:

- https://github.com/pcsg/steempunk-net-browser
- https://github.com/pcsg/steemit-steempunk-locale
- https://github.com/pcsg/steemit-steempunk-housing
- https://github.com/pcsg/steempunknet-discord-bot

The whole game is based on QUIQQER, here are additional repositories in the two-digit range. For example, some can be found at:

https://github.com/quiqqer

Once a user uses this repo, please point it out to him or keep an eye on it. STEEMPUNk-NET is OpenSource, but that someone has our repository structure in the blood we can't ask that. :-)

if you have some questions, you are welcome to ask @dehenne or @jedigeiss

Thank you for your work.
